# lc_realistic_recharge
Lethal Company Realistic Recharging mod.  "Recharging" only works on moons because the vanilla game doesn't allow death while on ship outside of game overs.

Inspired by [MetalRecharging](https://github.com/legoandmars/MetalRecharging), ItemChargerUpdate code and InteractPerformedPatch used from the same.  Handles the death from charging in a different way.
